# Unit 6 - Natural Language Processing Project

## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) is used in many apps and devices to interact with users and make meaning of text to determine how to respond, find information, or to create new text. Your goal is to use natural language processing techniques to identify structure, patterns, and meaning in a text to have conversations with a user, execute commands, perform manipulations on the text, or generate new text.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, ArrayLists, the String class, and algorithms to create a program that uses natural language processing techniques:

- **Create at least two ArrayLists** – Create at least two ArrayLists to store the data used in your program, such as data from text files or entered by the user.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and conditionals to find or manipulate elements in an ArrayList or String object.
- **Use methods in the String classs** - Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to divide text into sentences or phrases.
- **Use at least one natural language processing technique** – Use a natural language processing technique to process, analyze, and/or generate text.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

Our Translator is a simple english to spanish application designed to translate predefined English phrases into Spanish. The primary goal of this project is to provide users with an easy way to translate common phrases by utilizing predefined sentences. The goal of this project is to help users learn how to translate simple sentences by learning spanish vocabulary.

## NLP Techniques

We used our prompt() method to allow user interaction and choice in what is being printed out. Then we used the isInEglish() and returnSpanish() to have a way to look up the words we are trying to translate to allow a natural sentence to form. It is made in a way that looks natural to people so it will be easier to read and understand. Then our translateSentence() method breaks down the sentence into words to be able to be translated, as a type of tokenization. These methods are necesary to allow us to properly traverse through our .txt files so the phrase can be translated.
